The **Overview** (`/`) is the live home screen. Everything on it renders from the active
inverter's [capabilities](/profiles/concept/#from-roles-to-capabilities) — nothing is
hard-coded per vendor, so sections appear only for the subsystems your inverter actually
has. Live values arrive over a WebSocket at 1 Hz.

## The app shell

Every screen shares a collapsible left sidebar and a top bar:

- **Sidebar** — the active inverter's name, a "Monitoring" nav group (Overview, History,
  Costs, and — for admins — Controls and Settings), and a footer with the signed-in user and
  a sign-out button.
- **Top bar** — a breadcrumb, a **live status badge** ("Live" / "Connecting…"), and a
  light/dark theme toggle.

## Power flow

An animated single-line schematic: **PV strings ▸ Inverter ▸ Grid**, with **Battery**,
**Load**, and **Generator** branching off. Only present subsystems are drawn. Each node
shows an icon, its live power in watts, and a direction-sensed state (PV "Producing/Idle",
Battery "Charging/Discharging/Idle", Grid "Importing/Exporting", …). Animated dashed lines
show flow direction, with speed scaling to wattage; the grid line is **cost-colored** (green
when exporting, red when importing). The battery node carries a circular SoC gauge colored
red → orange → green.

## KPI cards

Up to four headline cards — **PV total power**, **battery power**, **grid power** (a
diverging red/green split at zero), and **load power** — each shown only if the metric
exists. Every card animates its current value and draws a live sparkline from a rolling
5-minute buffer.

## Subsystem sections

Below the KPIs, one card per subsystem present in the profile:

- **Battery** — a large SoC readout with charging/discharging state, power, and an animated
  bar, plus the remaining battery metrics.
- **Inverter** — status, relay status, DC and AC temperatures.
- **Solar · N strings** — power / voltage / current repeated per PV string.
- **Grid · N-phase** — per-phase voltage / current / power (1- or 3-phase).
- **Generator** and **Backup load** — shown when the profile has them.
