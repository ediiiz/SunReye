/**
 * Runtime state for composite controls (`controlExpr`) that need memory — today

 * restores it on unlock. Stored in `app_settings` under {@link CONTROL_STATE_KEY}.
 *
 * Presence-based: an entry exists only while a control is engaged (locked); it
 * is deleted on release. Keys are namespaced by active profile id so each
 * inverter profile keeps its own lock state — `${profileId}:${metricKey}`.
