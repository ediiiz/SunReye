description: Change writable inverter settings — validated everywhere, pushed immediately.
---

The **Controls** screen (`/controls`) exposes every **writable** setting the active profile
defines. It's **admin-only** and appears in the nav only when the profile has writable
controls. Changes are pushed to the inverter immediately, through the same validation used by
the [REST API](/integrations/rest-api/) and [MQTT bridge](/integrations/mqtt/).

## Inverter settings

Each writable metric in the `settings` group renders as a control whose widget is chosen
from the metric's shape:

| Metric shape | Widget |
| --- | --- |
| Boolean enum (0/1) | **Switch** |
| Larger enum | **Select** dropdown |
| Ranged number | **Slider** (commits on release) |
| Other numeric | **Input + Apply** button |

Each control shows the current value/label and unit, applies optimistically with a pending
state, and confirms with a success or error toast. Typical settings include charge/discharge
currents, work mode, grid charge, and solar-sell.

## Time-of-use schedule

If the profile exposes the time-of-use feature (as the Deye profile does), a **Time-of-use**
editor appears. Six periods repeat every day, each driving the battery toward a target SoC.

- A **Visual** tab shows a 24-hour timeline: one block per period, sized to its clock
  duration (wrapping midnight), block height = target SoC, amber = grid-charge-to-target vs
  blue = discharge-to-target, a lightning bolt on grid-charge periods, and a live "now"
  marker. Below it, a slot picker and a per-slot editor (start time, grid-charge switch,
  target SoC, max power, target voltage).
- A **Table** tab gives the same slots as inline-editable rows (enabled / start / power /
  voltage / SoC).

An optional solar-sell control sits above the tabs when the profile supports it.
