title: Authoring a Profile
description: Describe a new inverter with the typed profile SDK, validate it, and score its coverage.
---

You describe an inverter *as code* using the typed builders in
[`@sunreye/profile-sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sunreye/profile-sdk) (`bun add -d
@sunreye/profile-sdk`), compile it down to a serializable `ProfileData`, then validate and
score it with the same package's CLI. The SDK's job is to make the profile
**correct by construction** — picking a role forces you to supply exactly what that role
needs, or the code won't compile.

## `defineProfile` and `metric`

```ts
import { defineProfile, metric } from "@sunreye/profile-sdk";

export const acme = defineProfile({
  id: "acme-hybrid",
  name: "Acme Hybrid",
  manufacturer: "Acme",
  version: "1.0.0",
  metrics: [
    metric("dc/pv1/power", {
      label: "PV1 Power", group: "solar",
      role: "pv.string.power", index: 1, addr: 672, unit: "W",
    }),
    metric("battery/soc", {
      label: "Battery SoC", group: "battery",
      role: "battery.soc", addr: 588, unit: "%",
    }),
    metric("settings/work_mode", {
      label: "Work Mode", group: "settings",
      role: "setting.work_mode", access: "rw", addr: 142,
      enumLabels: { 0: "Selling First", 1: "Zero Export", 2: "Limited to Load" },
    }),
    metric("grid/total/power", {
      label: "Total Grid Power", group: "grid",
      computeExpr: { sum: ["grid.phase.power.1", "grid.phase.power.2"] },
    }),
  ],
});
```

`metric(topic, opts)` derives the entity `key` from the topic (`dc/pv1/power` →
`dc.pv1.power`) and defaults `type` (`U_WORD`), `scale` (`1`), `access` (`r`), and `unit`
(`null`) so the common case stays terse.

### The role makes the type demand its shape

The `role` you choose narrows what the rest of the argument must contain, read from the
[role catalog](/profiles/concept/#the-role-catalog):

- An **indexed** role (`pv.string.power`) ⇒ `index` is **required**.
- A **status/enum** role (`inverter.status`, `setting.work_mode`) ⇒ `enumLabels` is
  **required**.
- A **setting** (writable) role ⇒ `access: "rw"` is **required**.

Omit any of these and it's a compile error. A metric with **no role** is allowed — it's a
diagnostic value that isn't rendered by role.

### Addresses by register type

- `U_WORD` / `S_WORD` → one address: `addr: 672`
- `U_DWORD` → two addresses `[low, high]`: `addr: [672, 673]`
- computed (`computeExpr`) → no `addr`

### Compute expressions

Derived metrics use a small **closed** set — never arbitrary code:

| Expression | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `{ sum: ["a", "b", …] }` | Add the listed metric keys. |
| `{ diff: ["a", "b"] }` | `a − b`. |
| `{ scale: ["a", k] }` | `a × k`. |
| `{ combine: { add: [...], sub: [...] } }` | Sum of `add` keys minus sum of `sub` keys — a signed linear mix. `sub` is optional. |
| `{ ratio: { num: [...], den: [...], scale? } }` | `(Σnum / Σden) × scale` (`scale` defaults to `1`). A zero denominator reads as `0`, so idle/overnight samples never divide by zero. |

Referenced keys are resolved from the live sample at compute time; a **missing key reads as
0**. A computed metric may only reference metrics defined **earlier** (no forward references).

### Deferred aggregates: `sumOf`

A hand-listed `sum` drifts the moment a model adds or drops a member. `sumOf` lets you
declare the **intent** once — "sum every PV-string power" — and resolves it to a concrete
`{ sum: [...] }` against the *final* metric set at build time:

```ts
import { metric, sumOf } from "@sunreye/profile-sdk";

metric("dc/total_power", {
  label: "PV Total", group: "solar", unit: "W",
  role: "pv.total.power",
  computeExpr: sumOf({ role: "pv.string.power" }), // every metric carrying this role
});
```

Select members by **`role`** (every metric with that canonical role) or by **`keyPrefix`**
(the exact key plus every `${prefix}.` descendant, e.g. `sumOf({ keyPrefix: "battery.bank" })`);
the carrier never sums itself. The token is resolved and **stripped before validation**, so
an emitted profile still contains only the closed `{ sum: [...] }` form and the runtime
engine sees nothing new. **Fail-loud:** an aggregate that matches zero metrics is a build
error, never a silent empty sum.

The payoff shows up in families (below): because it resolves against *each model's*
surviving metrics, a variant that drops a PV string re-derives the correct total on its own
— no per-model patch.

## Families & model variants

A single repo holds **as many profiles as you like** — hundreds is fine (`index.json` plus
one `profiles/<id>.json` per model). When a manufacturer ships several models on the same
register map that differ only in a few limits or PV inputs — e.g. the Deye SG05LP3-EU-SM2
line, whose SUN-14K…SUN-20K SKUs share everything but their battery current ceiling — don't
copy the whole map. Author them as a **family**: one shared base plus a `models` record
keyed by profile id.

```ts
import { defineFamily, metric } from "@sunreye/profile-sdk";

export const acme = defineFamily({
  id: "acme-hybrid",           // the generic base profile, emitted first
  name: "Acme Hybrid",
  manufacturer: "Acme",
  version: "1.0.0",
  metrics: [ /* the shared register map: 2 PV strings, a writable discharge limit, … */ ],
  models: {
    "acme-hybrid-5k": {
      name: "Acme Hybrid 5K",
      metrics: {
        "dc.pv2.*": null,                                            // one MPPT
        "settings.battery.maximum_discharge_current": { max: 120 },
      },
    },
    "acme-hybrid-15k": {
      name: "Acme Hybrid 15K",
      metrics: { "settings.battery.maximum_discharge_current": { max: 280 } },
    },
  },
});
```

`defineFamily` returns `[base, ...models]` — the generic base first (still selectable), then
one **self-contained** `ProfileData` per model. Export it and `profile build` picks up every
profile at once; each appears in SunReye's model picker, so a user selects their exact model
and its limits follow.

### The overlay: one rule per entry

Each `models[id].metrics` is a record keyed by canonical metric key that overlays the base:

| Entry | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `"key": { max: 280 }` (or `min`, or any `metric()` field like `addr`/`scale`) | **patch** — merge those fields into that metric; `min`/`max` set its `range` |
| `"key": null` | **remove** that metric |
| `"prefix.*": null` | **remove** every metric under the prefix (e.g. a whole PV string) |
| `"new.key": { …full definition… }` | **add** a new metric (topic derived from the key, `.` → `/`) |

Keys **autocomplete** from the base map (the base's key union is threaded through the model
types). Because wildcards and adds are also arbitrary strings, a typo can't be told apart
from an add by the compiler — instead it's caught at build/load time: patching or removing a
key that isn't in the base throws, as does a wildcard that matches nothing.

Because [capabilities are *derived*](/profiles/concept/), not declared, these edits reshape
the manifest automatically: dropping `dc.pv2.*` makes the UI report one PV string, and a
`range` on a writable setting renders a capped slider that also **rejects out-of-range
writes** server-side (that's how "SUN15 = max 280 A discharge" is enforced end to end). No
schema, hydrate, or server change is involved — the whole feature is authoring-side data.

To specialize a single imported or third-party `ProfileData` instead of a co-located base,
use the low-level primitive `defineVariant(base, { id, name?, metrics? })`.

### Removing a metric that others reference

Dropping a metric another one depends on used to fail late and opaquely (a
`references unknown metric key` error at load). `defineFamily`/`defineVariant` now reconcile
the survivors as part of applying the overlay:

- a removed key inside a **variadic** compute list (`sum`, `combine.add`/`sub`,
  `ratio.num`/`den`) is **pruned** from it — the same edit you'd make by hand;
- a removed key inside a **fixed-arity** expr (`diff`, `scale`), one whose removal would
  **empty a required list**, or a **control target**, **throws** at build time — naming both
  metrics — rather than silently changing the value (an emptied `ratio.den`, say, would read
  a constant `0`).

So removing `dc.pv2.*` from a base whose `dc.total_power` is
`{ sum: ["dc.pv1.power", "dc.pv2.power"] }` leaves `{ sum: ["dc.pv1.power"] }` with **no
manual patch**. Author the total as [`sumOf({ role: "pv.string.power" })`](#deferred-aggregates-sumof)
and the base carries no explicit key list at all — every model's total simply tracks its own
strings.

## Validation

A single Zod schema is the gate for **every** ingested profile — at author time, at
download time, and at server boot. It is strict:

- unknown keys are rejected;
- addresses are bounded (0–65535) and their count must match the register `type`;
- **semantic lints**: duplicate keys, duplicate wire addresses, indexed role without
  `index`, enum role without `enumLabels`, setting role without `rw`, and `computeExpr`
  referencing unknown or forward keys.

Because a profile is pure data, a bad profile can only fail validation or produce an empty
manifest — **it can never execute code**.

Within a family the SDK catches dependency breakage a step earlier still: an overlay that
removes a metric a survivor references throws at `defineFamily`/`defineVariant` time, naming
both metrics, before the profile ever reaches this schema (see
[Removing a metric that others reference](#removing-a-metric-that-others-reference)).

## The `profile` CLI

`@sunreye/profile-sdk` ships a `profile` command with three subcommands. It exits non-zero
on failure, so it works as a CI or pre-commit gate.

### `profile validate <file>`

Runs the strict schema + semantic lints against a `ProfileData` JSON file. Prints `✓` or a
list of `• path: message` issues.

```bash
bunx profile validate ./profiles/acme.json
```

### `profile coverage <file>`

Validates, then reports how many canonical roles are mapped and which are missing —
directly telling you what *won't* render:

```
mapped 31/50 canonical roles
missing: grid.power, battery.soc, pv.string.power[] …
```

Indexed roles are marked with `[]`.

```bash
bunx profile coverage ./profiles/acme.json
```

### `profile scaffold <csv>`

Turns a vendor Modbus register-table CSV into a starter `ProfileData` (roles left unmapped
for you to fill in). Columns: `topic,label,unit,group,addr,type,scale,access` (order-
independent; `topic` required; multi-register `addr` is `|`-separated). Prints JSON to
stdout for piping and hand-editing:

```bash
bunx profile scaffold ./deye-registers.csv \
  --id acme-hybrid --name "Acme Hybrid" --manufacturer Acme --version 0.1.0 \
  > profiles/acme.json
```

The real authoring work is transcribing the register map and assigning roles; scaffold gives
you the skeleton.

### `profile build <entries...> --out <dir>`

Turns code-defined profiles into a complete, installable
[profile repo](/profiles/distribution/): validates every profile, writes one
`profiles/<id>.json` per profile, and regenerates the root `index.json`:

```bash
bunx profile build ./src/profiles.ts --out . --name "My Profiles" --maintainer you
```

An entry is either a `ProfileData` JSON file or a TS/JS module — every export that is a
profile, a `{ profile, description }` wrapper (the description shows up in SunReye's repo
browser), or an array of either gets included. Any invalid profile or duplicate id fails
the whole build, so a broken repo never gets published. The same logic is available
programmatically as `buildRepo(entries, { name, maintainer })`.

## Testing without hardware

The SDK's test harness (`exerciseProfile`) runs a `ProfileData` end to end offline —
validate → hydrate → build the manifest → derive capabilities → generate one simulated
sample — so you can assert identity and capabilities in a unit test with **zero hardware**.

## Publishing

Once a profile validates and covers the roles you need, publish it to a git repo so others
can install it at runtime — see [Distributing Profiles](/profiles/distribution/).
