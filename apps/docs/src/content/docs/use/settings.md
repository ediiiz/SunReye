title: Settings
description: Configure the inverter connection, MQTT, tariff, profiles, and users from the UI.
---

The **Settings** screen (`/settings`) is where the deployment is configured at runtime —
most of it without touching `.env` or restarting. The whole screen is **admin-only**. A
live status poll keeps the connection badges fresh.

Tabs: **Inverter**, **MQTT & Home Assistant**, **Tariff**, **Date & Time** (any admin), plus
**Profiles**, **Users**, and **API Keys** (admin).

## Inverter

Configure the **Modbus connection**: host, port, transport (**Modbus TCP** or
**RTU-over-TCP**), unit id, timeout, and poll interval. A status badge shows Connected /
Disconnected / Simulated.

- **Test connection** captures a live snapshot and opens a table (metric / group / value)
  so you can sanity-check the mapping before saving.
- **Save** applies the change live — no restart.
- The **active profile** is shown here read-only; changing it lives on the
  [Profiles](#profiles) tab and takes effect on restart.
- If simulation mode is on (`INVERTER_SIMULATE`), a notice explains the settings are saved
  but unused.

## MQTT & Home Assistant

Configure the [MQTT bridge](/integrations/mqtt/): enable switch, broker URL, topic prefix,
username, and a write-only password field. A **Home Assistant discovery** switch reveals the
discovery prefix. A status badge shows Disabled / Connecting… / Connected, with a **Test
connection** button. Saving applies live.

## Tariff

Configure pricing for the [Costs](/use/costs/) screen: currency, standing charge, feed-in
rate, a default import price, and **time-of-use bands** (name, price, hour range, weekday
selection). Add or remove bands and **Save tariff**.

## Date & Time

How timestamps render across the History charts and stepper. Two controls — a **clock
format** (automatic/locale, 24-hour, or 12-hour) and a **time zone** (automatic, i.e. the
viewer's, or any IANA zone) — with a **live preview** of "now". The setting is
**instance-wide**: it applies to everyone using this instance, and only admins can change it.

## Profiles

Manage inverter [profiles](/profiles/concept/) (admin only), in three sections:

- **Installed profiles** — set active or remove, with built-in vs downloaded and version
  shown. A **Restart required** banner appears after activating or installing.
- **Profile repositories** — add/remove/enable git repo sources. Sources **auto-save** as you
  edit, with optimistic updates.
- **Available profiles** — **Browse** enabled repos. Profiles are grouped by **manufacturer**
  and, within that, by **family** (collapsible), and each row shows its **source repo**. Per
  profile: Download, or Update when the repo offers a semver-newer release.

At the top, an **updates banner** surfaces installed profiles with a newer version waiting —
each with a one-click *Update to vX*. A [background checker](/profiles/distribution/#update-checking)
refreshes this every few hours, so you see updates without browsing.

See [Distributing Profiles](/profiles/distribution/) for the full flow.

## Users

Manage accounts (admin only): add a user (name, email, password, role) and edit or delete
users in a table, including changing roles inline. See [Users & Roles](/use/users/).

## API Keys

Issue and revoke API keys for the [REST API](/integrations/rest-api/) (admin only):

- **Issue key** — pick the owning user, name the key, and optionally set an expiry
  (30 days / 90 days / 1 year / never). On create, the full key is shown **once** in a
  dialog with a copy button — store it then, as only a short prefix is kept afterwards.
- **Keys table** — filter by user; each row shows name, owner, prefix, created/expiry dates.
  **Revoke** deletes a key immediately; requests using it then return `401`.

Keys are stored hashed and work alongside the static `API_KEYS`
[environment variable](/reference/environment/). See
[REST API → Authentication](/integrations/rest-api/#authentication) for how they're presented
on requests.

:::note
Client-side admin gating is UX only — every mutation is enforced on the server.
