/**
 * Rewrite root-absolute asset URLs in the adapter-static fallback page to
 * relative ones. SvelteKit deliberately emits `/_app/...` in the fallback
 * (it can't know the depth a fallback will be served from), but this app
 * uses the hash router, so the document URL is always exactly the served
 * root — `./_app/...` is always correct, and root-absolute URLs would
 * escape a path-prefixed reverse proxy (Home Assistant ingress serves the
 * app at /api/hassio_ingress/<token>/).
 *
 * Runs as part of `bun run build:static` (the addon build); the adapter-node
 * build renders HTML per-request with relative paths and doesn't need this.
